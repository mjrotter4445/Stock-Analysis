# An Analysis of Module 2 Challenge Project - 
# Code Refactoring Challenge in VBAChallenge spreadsheet
Performing analysis on the editing & refactoring process on the Module 2 code to determine whether it can run more efficiently.  

# Module 2 Refactor Project
## Overview of the Project

Refactor the Module 2 solution code & measure performance.  Determine if improvements were made and present and explain the findings.  
### Purpose and Background 
The purpose of our work was to use the original All Stocks Analysis VBA code and improve the performance or this tool.  We can analyze much larger sets of data more efficiently such as the entire stock market over the past few years.    

## Results 

Timed results before the refactoring

## Summary 
The advantages of refactoring code in general are 1) the ability to analyze larger data sets with speed and to better organize, clean, and maintain code.   The disadvantages of refactored code is that refactoring may run into underlying architecture issues and problems.   It takes a lot of skill and time (expense) to refactor code, especially code written by other programmers.    In this exercise, the refactored code is intended to improve the performance of this DQ Analysis program when run.   
After code was refactored, I ran the stock analysis, to confirm that our stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as the data set example provided (images below from Module 2 – Dataset examples). 
Please note: in the Resources folder you can find the pop-up messages for elapsed run time for refactored code.   These images are named 2017 run time.png and 2018 run time.png. 

The end result was to look like this.

Finally, we run the stock analysis, to confirm that our stock analysis outputs for 2017 and 2018 are the same as the data set example provided (images below from Module 2 – Dataset examples). Also, in the Resources folder you can find the pop-up messages for elapsed run time for refactored code.   These images are named 2017 run time.png and 2018 run time.png.
